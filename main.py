        {transcript}
        ---

        ### TASK AND INSTRUCTIONS ###
        Analyze the provided meeting transcript based on the product context above. First, determine if the meeting was primarily about **ERP**, **ASP**, or a combination of both. Then, extract the following 47 data points. For scoring, evaluate how well the sales rep pitched the relevant product's features and handled objections. If a specific piece of information is not mentioned, you MUST return "N/A".

        Your output MUST be a single, valid JSON object.
